# Simulator

The simulator is a useful development tool that allows you to become familiar with our API and test out robotics concepts even if you haven't finished building your robot yet.

The simulator is built around the [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/#download) platform, which runs the simulation.
You control the virtual robot using the [sbot API](../programming/), just like on the physical robots.

## Setup

To use the simulator, you will need to install the simulator software and download our simulation environment.
This is detailed in the [Setting up the Simulator](./setup) section.

Once you're set up, the [Using the Simulator](./usage) section provides details on how to use the simulator software and get started on developing the code for your simulated robot.

## The Robot

The simulator contains a pre-built robot, constructed around a set of simulated kit components.
The connected boards and sensors are covered in the [Simulated Robot](./robot) section.
